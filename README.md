# Encryption Project

This is a Java-based encryption project that demonstrates basic message encryption techniques. The project was created as a learning exercise inspired by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) tutorials to deepen understanding of Java programming fundamentals.

## Project Overview

The **Encryption Project** allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages, serving as a practical introduction to Java and basic encryption techniques. This project was developed to explore Java programming concepts, object-oriented programming, and simple encryption logic.

## Features

- **Encrypt Messages**: Converts plain text messages into encrypted text using a simple algorithm.
- **Decrypt Messages**: Allows encrypted messages to be converted back to their original form.
- **User-Friendly Console Interface**: Interacts with users through a simple console interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language used to implement the encryption and decryption logic.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/otuemre/encryptionProject.git
   ```
2. **Open in an IDE**: Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java-compatible IDE.
3. **Run the Project**: Compile and run the main file to start encrypting and decrypting messages through the console interface.
